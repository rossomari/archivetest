      "bioUrl": "Sigmund Freud was an Austrian neurologist who founded psychoanalysis. Born in Freiberg, Moravia (now part of Czech Republic), Freud developed groundbreaking theories about the unconscious mind and the interpretation of dreams. His seminal work, \"The Interpretation of Dreams\" (1899), established dreams as \"the royal road to the unconscious\".\n\nFreud proposed that dreams represent wish fulfillment, where repressed desires and unconscious thoughts emerge in disguised forms. He distinguished between dreams' manifest content (what we remember) and latent content (hidden meanings). According to Freud, the mind employs \"dream work\" mechanisms such as condensation, displacement, and symbolization to transform forbidden wishes into less threatening imagery.\n\nThroughout his career, Freud analyzed numerous dreams, including his own famous \"Irma's injection\" dream, to demonstrate how dreams reflect unconscious processes. His dream theory remained central to psychoanalytic practice, though many aspects have been challenged by later research."

      "bioUrl": "Carl Gustav Jung was a Swiss psychiatrist who founded analytical psychology. Initially a close collaborator with Freud, Jung later developed his own theories about the psyche, dreams, and the collective unconscious.\n Unlike Freud, Jung viewed dreams as direct expressions of the unconscious rather than disguised wishes. He believed dreams serve a compensatory function, balancing conscious attitudes with unconscious perspectives. Jung introduced key concepts like archetypes (universal symbolic patterns), the collective unconscious (shared ancestral memories), and individuation (the psychological process of integrating the conscious with the unconscious).\n Jung distinguished between \"little dreams\" (reflecting personal concerns) and \"big dreams\" (containing powerful archetypal images with greater significance). His own dream journal, known as \"The Red Book,\" documented his personal exploration of the unconscious through dreams and active imagination.\nJung's approach to dream interpretation emphasized amplification—exploring associations, cultural meanings, and archetypal significance of dream symbols—rather than reducing dreams to repressed wishes."

Once part of Freud's inner circle, Adler broke away to develop his own psychological approach emphasizing social interest and the striving for superiority to overcome feelings of inferiority.\n Adler's dream theory differed significantly from Freud's. He viewed dreams not as expressions of repressed wishes but as rehearsals for future actions or problem-solving attempts. Dreams, according to Adler, reflect the dreamer's current life challenges and goals, serving to prepare the individual for upcoming situations or decisions.For Adler, dreams reveal the dreamer's lifestyle and core beliefs about themselves and their place in the world. In dream interpretation, he focused less on symbolic meaning and more on how dreams reflected the individual's characteristic patterns of thinking and behaving."

He proposed that dreams reflect the dreamer's \"cognitive system\" —their conceptions of self and others, their problems, conflicts, and concerns.\n Unlike psychoanalytic approaches, Hall's cognitive theory suggested that dreams do not disguise meanings but transparently reflect the dreamer's thoughts, feelings, and personal world.
